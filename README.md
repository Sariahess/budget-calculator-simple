# budget-calculator-simple
simple form of budget calculator (one-time use, the data would not be saved upon refreshing the webpage)

## How to use

1. The top section shows the user 4 main factors:

(1) Available budget in (Month) (Year): shows the current month and the year

(2) "$ 0.00" that shows the total, amount of earnings and spendings added together. 

(3) Income: earnings section (total of '+ values')

(4) Expenses: spendings section (total of '- values') which also shows % of the expenses amount against the income amount. (i.e. if the income is $100 and the expenses is $120, the percentage would shows 120%)


2. The middle input section shows user 2 factors:

(1) Add description (input bar): Type in texts to describe the earning or spending

(2) Value: 
```
Click the arrow button to decrease (down arrow) to register spendings by 1 dollar per click 
[Likewise, up arrow to increase value to register earnings by 1 dollar per click]
```
or
```
Type in the number amount (one period for decimal allowed) with + or no sign for adding to income, and - sign for adding to expenses
```
__typing in numbers with more than one decimal point will not register__

(3) Check-mark button: Click on it to register either the earning or the spending. Both 'description' and 'value' have to be set properly (i.e. description must entail at least an empty space with once space-bar press) otherwise the content would not be registered.


3. The bottom list section shows 2 sides to the user:

(1) left "registered income" side in turquoise

(2) right "registered expenses" side in red

```
each expense amount has its own percentage calculated against the total income amount
```


4. The percentage on expenses will show "infinity %" when there is no registered income. 


5. Upon refreshing the webpage, all registered budget data would be cleared out, all totals set to 0 dollars.
